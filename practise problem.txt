b.	What is the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of 10 persons, exactly one has travelled abroad.
c.	What is the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of 10 persons, exactly two persons have travelled abroad.
d.	What is the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of 10 persons, exactly three persons have travelled abroad.
e.	What is the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of 10 persons, exactly four persons have travelled abroad.
f.	What is the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of 10 persons, exactly five persons have travelled abroad.
g.	What is the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of 10 persons, exactly six persons have travelled abroad.
h.	What is the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of 10 persons, exactly seven persons have travelled abroad.
i.	What is the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of 10 persons, exactly eight persons have travelled abroad.
j.	What is the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of 10 persons, all 10 persons have travelled abroad. 
3.	Plot the probability values as a Table / Bar graph/plot and interpret
4.	What is the probability that in the randomly chosen sample of 100 persons at least 59 have travelled abroad?

Lab 07/10

que) 	 Suppose the manufacturer claims that the mean lifetime of a ball bearing is 10000hours.
	 The auditing team stated that the mean lifetime is less than what is claimed. On the basis of
	 a randomly chosen sample of 50 ball bearings as given in the dataset, at 0.05 significance level, 
	 can we reject the claim of the manufacturer? What will be your interpretation if the significance level is made as 0.01?
